# SteamoddedNX - A Balatro ModLoader for Nintendo Switch

## Prelude

Warning! By using this mod you PROMISE not to ask for help in the official Balatro server! Discussion of any sort of console modding of Balatro is forbidden (for their safety) and will likely result in a warning or a ban from the server. Just don't do it. Secondly, do not bother Steamo or any mod makers on the topic of making their mods work on older versions of Steamodded. Find older versions that work or don't use lovely! 

## Introduction

SteamoddedNX is a mod loader and injector for the game Balatro. Much like the [LÃ–VE2D engine](https://love2d.org/wiki/Main_Page) itself, it is built using [Lua](https://www.lua.org/). It is made with modularity and extensibility in mind, providing a large selection of APIs and other features to facilitate bringing your ideas to life.

## Installation

### How to Install SteamoddedNX

Please refer to the [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded/wiki/01.-Getting-started) in the Steamodded guide. While it is possible to use the injector for versions 0.9.8 and below, this method is no longer recommended and is deprecated starting in version 1.0, which is currently in Alpha.

## How to Install a Mod

- Navigate to your Mods directory (see the installation instructions).
- Put the mod into that directory. (The mod can be a single file if there is only one file provided, or it can be a whole folder.)
- Launch the game and enjoy!

## Limitations

- Lovely is not supported on the switch, so mods that require it will not work.
- Obviously, limited to mods that function on 0.9.8 version of sMOD.
- Card suit customization introduced in version 1.0.1g (Friends of Jimbo) do not work.

## Thanks

Thanks to Steamo and co for helping develop such a versatile tool that basically works on any platform. I only needed to make a couple of minor adjustments to make this not crash on switch.
Thank you to the mod community that make amazing add-ons and of course thanks to localthunk for making such an amazing, addictive game.
