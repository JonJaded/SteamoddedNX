# SteamoddedNX - A Balatro ModLoader for Nintendo Switch

## Introduction

SteamoddedNX is a mod loader and injector for the game Balatro. Much like the [LÃ–VE2D engine](https://love2d.org/wiki/Main_Page) itself, it is built using [Lua](https://www.lua.org/). It is made with modularity and extensibility in mind, providing a large selection of APIs and other features to facilitate bringing your ideas to life.

## Installation

### How to Install SteamoddedNX

Please refer to the [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded/wiki/01.-Getting-started) in the Steamodded guide. While it is possible to use the injector for versions 0.9.8 and below, this method is no longer recommended and is deprecated starting in version 1.0, which is currently in Alpha.

## How to Install a Mod

- Navigate to your Mods directory (see the installation instructions).
- Put the mod into that directory. (The mod can be a single file if there is only one file provided, or it can be a whole folder.)
- Launch the game and enjoy!
